This music based project is inspired by my love for hip hop music and the expression and relief that it provides to members of it's community. J Dilla is a well known hip-hop producer that viewed his work as a craft to love and cherish. Similarly I view software-development as a craft and am trying to hone and develop my skills.

This Project is now [**live**](https://jordan-carlile.github.io/jDillaDrumMachine/) via github pages at:
