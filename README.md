You have come so far,you've got so far to go.
-J Dilla

This music based project is inspired by my love for hip hop music and the expression and relief that it provides to members of its' community. J Dilla is a well known hip-hop producer that viewed his work as a craft to love and cherish. Similarly I view software-development as a craft and am trying to hone and develop my skills.
